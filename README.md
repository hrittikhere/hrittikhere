_Loft is building the solution for the cloud and cloud native that help Companies Scale Access To Kubernetes From 10 To 10,000 Engineers._


## ðŸš€ An interconnected Ecosystem

Building Dev Tooling with the best technology to our open-source community and to our loyal customer base is our mission. Here's the our own open source projects that can help you:

- [vCluster](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster) - Create fully functional virtual Kubernetes clusters - Each vcluster runs inside a namespace of the underlying k8s cluster. It's cheaper than creating separate full-blown clusters and it offers better multi-tenancy and isolation than regular namespaces and 40 million virtual clusters using vCluster are created since 2021.

- [DevPod](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod) - Codespaces but open-source, client-only and unopinionated: Works with any IDE and lets you use any cloud, kubernetes or just localhost docker.

- [jsPolicy](https://github.com/loft-sh/jspolicy) - Easier & Faster Kubernetes Policies using JavaScript or TypeScript.
